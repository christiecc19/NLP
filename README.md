# NLP and Topic Modeling on User Review Dataset
Clustered unlableled textual documents into groups and discovered latent semantic structures using Python.

Preporcessed text by tokenizing, stemming and stop-words removing and extracted features by term frequency-inverse ducument frequency(TF-IDF) approach.

Tranined unsupervised learning models of K-Means Clustering and Ladent Dirichlet Allocatin.

Identified latent topics and keywords of each document for clustering and calculated document similarity.
