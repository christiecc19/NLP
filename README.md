# NLP and Topic Modeling on User Review Dataset
Clustered unlableled textual documents into groups and discovered latent semantic structures using Python
Preporcessed text by tokenizing, stemming and stop-words removing and extracted features by term frequency-inverse ducument frequency(TF-IDF) approach
Tranined unsupervised learning models of K-Means Clustering and Ladent Dirichlet Allocatin
Identified latent topics and keywords of each document for clustering and calculated document similarity
visualized momdel traing results by dimensinality reduction using Principal Component Analysis
Dataset: synopses_list_imdb.txt,synopses_list_imdb.txt,title_list.txt
code: NLP.ipynb
